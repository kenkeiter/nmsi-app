# NMSI App Base

We provide a nice HTTParty-based abstraction for NMSI materials index. Fun! Now we're going to build something on top of it.

The only thing this is missing is cats with lasers shooting out of their eyes!

# Development

Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:kenkeiter/nmsi-app.git`

Install the bundle: `bundle install`

Also, there's a cool rake task to load the lib and start an IRB console. Start it like this: `bundle exec rake console`

# Rules

Fork and play, submit pull requests to me.
